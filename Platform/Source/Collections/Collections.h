// File:	Collections.h
// Purpose: Include file for collections
//===============================================================

// Design Note: 
// Collections will be developed on a per-need basis. While STL/STLPort and Boost++ are all
// options, creating a custom product will allow for faster and tigher controll on a case
// by case basis. Templated collections should be created in the platform layer and included 
// into this file.
